## Description

This project was designed to enhance my Python programming skills by implementing a practical application that performs PDF invoice scraping and data structuring. The program leverages the pdfplumber library to extract data from PDF invoices and then organizes this data into an Excel spreadsheet using openpyxl. Additionally, the project utilizes the tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface for final formatting and interaction.
